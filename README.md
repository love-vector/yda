# YDA â€“ Open-Source Java AI Assistant

YDA is a software project designed to empower Java enterprises with cutting-edge AI Assistant capabilities. Adopting a modular approach, YDA enables the development of custom components, offering flexibility to create tailored solutions or select from pre-built options.

## Using YDA

YDA binaries are available at [repo.yda](#).    
To access the latest features, YDA can be built from source.    
JDK 11 is required for YDA core functionality, while JDK 17 is necessary for Spring integrations.

Building from Source
-------
To build YDA and publish to a local Maven Repository:  

```bash 
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
 ``` 

This command builds all JARs and documentation, then publishes them to the local Maven Repository. Tests are not executed by this command. To build everything, including tests, use:  

```bash 
./gradlew build
 ```
